COVID19 Diagnosis Prediction - List of Contribution 

 

Team Members: MaoLiang Liu, Chenlu Huang, Jun Guo 

 

Please see below list of contributions made by each of the team members. Because we often work together and sometimes expand on works initiated by others, there are overlapping sections among the members. Lastly, we would just like to note that all members were able to attend all scheduled meetings and actively engaged in the online and offline group discussions. The responsibilities are fairly distributed among the members.
